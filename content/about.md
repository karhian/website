Hello World. My name is Kar Hian. I am a recent graduate from the university of Toronto majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I aspire to be a data scientist preferabally in the financial services industry. This website is for me to share my statictical analysis from my survey, sampling and observational data course. I hope to potentially expand this website to include more projects of my own.
