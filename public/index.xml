AbstractPedestrian is part and parcel of life in a city. In this paper, we explore the transportation data for the years 2008 and 2011 which is an observational dataset. We find that there exists some correlation between pedestrian collision and TTC stops. Our findings have implications for forecasting pedestrian collision prone areas and the factors that may cause it.
IntroductionWith health being the talk of the world, something that is not being talked enough is pedestrian safety.</description>
